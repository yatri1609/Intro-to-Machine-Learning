# Assignment 4 Instructions

In this assignment, you'll be following the tutorial code to generate sentences from your own text file. This homework is very easy.

## 1.
Download a dataset. You would want something pretty long, for example using a book. In the tutorial, the generated sequence was trained using "Alice in Wonderland."

## 2.
Generate a 20-character long sequence.


# Grading rubric
**Out of 100 points**

- 10 points: Load the dataset properly
- 50 points: Have the neural network train.
- 40 points: Have the neural network be able to generate some semblance of text (such as valid English words) even if the text is non-sensical or overfit.
